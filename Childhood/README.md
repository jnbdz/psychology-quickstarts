## Tricks
> My opinions! Always ask for help from a specialist. These notes are based on experiences and tricks that I have discovered over the years.
- **Problem:** The parent has to argue with the child to get them to go to bed.
    - **Solutions:**
        - Do **not** use _going to bed_ as a punishment (use a seperate space for grounding)
        - Make going to bed a positive (e.g.: "you are lucky to go to bed", etc)
    - **Reason:**
        - If you use _going to bed_ as a punishment then the child will think you are punishing them when you are not.
- **Problem:** You tell the child to **not** do *X* but then they do it.
    - **Solution:**
        - Give an idea (verbal image) of the consequence of doing *X*. (example: "Do not run around the pool" -> "If you run around the pool you might slip and hurt yourself")
    - **Reason:**
        - This is what is known as **negative suggestion**. Humans work with images in their minds. So if I say don't think of a black cat you will think of a black cat. So saying to the child "do not run around the pool" he imagines him/her self running around the pool. By saying that phrase you actually gave them the idea. So you need to change the image in their minds to something that will discourage them. Same with adults. It is worst with a child because of the Frontal lobe of the brain is not yet very develop.
- **Problem:** Cannot focus well.
    - **Solution:**
        - Seperation of rooms (env) for different activities. Adults benefit from this too.
        - You can also train the child using a *brain-reading headset* whilst they play a video game (if they don't concentrate well the video game will not go well). Do this multiple times using games that the child likes and wants to succeed in.
    - **Reason:**
        - Too many to count! ;)
        - Distraction
        - Many others...
- **Problem:** Depression
    - **Solution:**
        - Look at what you might be doing that might be toxic (meaning go consult ;)) (we are all imperfect)
        - Look into his/her env. that might be the source
        - Isolate from the toxic sources
        - Give a sense of selfworth and importance through responsibilities
        - Exercise (too many do not do anything physical that is horrible for the mind)
        - **SENTENCE:** "Suicide, the long term solution to a short term problem"
            - Sometimes practicle
            - Avoid it with some because it feels that you believe it just temp when it is not for the one affected
            - Many use this out of fear of dealing with the other persons demons
            - Many use this to also quickly *pretend help* (if you cannot help ask for someone else)
        - *Thoughts are lies* we often let our mind guide us into the pit of hell... Just ignore it. They are just lies. Even if there are parts that are true they are exaggerated. Often your mind is your enemy.
        - CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is amazing!
        - Avoid scares like global warming, wars, etc. Just things you cannot control.
        - Avoid coffee, too many carbs and sugar.
        - I have seen parents scare their kids with their financial situation. That is stupid. No! You are wrong it is not educational. What is the kid supposed to do? Teach about finances if you understand it if not shut up ;)
        - Think of others
        - Help others
        - Great video: [This could be why you're depressed or anxious | Johann Hari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5IX-np5fE)
    - **Reason:**
        - Many

## Bullying
Types (my own terms): 
- psychopath
    - They use violence on others
    - The intention is to harm
    - Asocial (do not have friends if they do they are most of time in groupes of 3 one is the alpha the others sheeps (betas))
    - Most are boys
- harasser
    - Most are girls or physically weak boys (small, very weak mustle strength)
    - "Death by a thousand cuts"
- fake victim (user of authority)
    - Will contact a teacher, the principal, the police, etc to lie about an individual to use authority to bully them

That being said there is fourth type. But this type is seperate because of the intentions. His/her intention is to protect others. They will use violence, psychological warfare, etc to push back one of the 3 other types. They are sometimes hard to indentify because they can easily be confused with one of the 3 types mentioned in the list.

### How to identify the bully
- Talk to the children to find out their experience with the different students
- Map out the relationships of the children
- From there you can easily find out who's who

> I might later on add a list of questions to ask to map out the social relationships

> **NOTE:** I am very worried about the anti-bullying happening in our schools because most don't understand it and often the bully can be seen as the victim and the victim as the bully. I do not trust most to be able to determine this unless they have a good grasp of the subject. This can also be said for the work place.
